Student Result Management System (Java – Exception Handling)

This project is a Java-based Student Result Management System that demonstrates extensive use of exception handling, including built-in exceptions, custom exceptions, input validation, and safe user interaction using try-catch-finally blocks.
The system allows users to add students, validate marks, store multiple students, and display complete result reports.
